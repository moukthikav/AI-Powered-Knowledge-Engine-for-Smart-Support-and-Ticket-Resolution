# ü§ñ AI-Powered Knowledge Engine for Smart Support & Ticket Resolution

> An intelligent platform to streamline customer support by leveraging AI and large language models for real-time knowledge access, content categorization, and article recommendations.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an **AI-based knowledge management platform** tailored for customer support teams. Using large language models (LLMs) like **OpenAI GPT** and **Meta LLaMA**, the system automatically tags, categorizes, and recommends relevant support articles based on ticket content.  

By integrating with tools like **Google Sheets** (for data handling) , it enables real-time solution suggestions, identifies knowledge gaps, and improves support efficiency.  

**Key Goals:**
- Faster and more organized access to knowledge articles  
- Real-time article recommendations based on ticket context  
- Identification of content gaps for continuous knowledge base improvement  
- Reduced resolution times with minimal manual intervention
